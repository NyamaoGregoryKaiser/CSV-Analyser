# Earthquake Tracker App

Welcome to the Earthquake Tracker App, a project developed as part of the ICS 265-50 C Programming course at Metropolitan State University for Summer 2024. This application is designed to track and analyze significant earthquakes around the world over the past 30 days using data from the US Geological Survey (USGS).

## Features

- **Display Earthquake Data**: The app displays the time, magnitude, cost, and location of significant earthquakes.
- **Data Analysis**: Calculate the total number of earthquakes, their sum, and their average magnitude.
- **Cost Calculation**: Estimate the damage cost based on the magnitude of each earthquake.

## Extra Credit Features

- **Sorting Functionality**: Sort earthquake data in descending order by magnitude multiplied by $1,000,000.
- **Demonstration Requirement**: Show your working program during office hours for extra credit.

## Project Requirements

1. **Data Source**: 
   - USGS Significant Earthquakes (Past 30 Days): [CSV Data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php)

2. **Core Functionality**:
   - Display earthquake details: time, magnitude, cost, and place.
   - Calculate and display the count, sum, and average of magnitudes.
   - Calculate the damage cost using the formula: `damage cost = magnitude x 1,000,000`.

3. **Deliverables**:
   - Upload your `Project6.c` file.
   - Include a screenshot of the output displaying your name and date.

4. **Extra Credits**:
   - Save the modified file as `Extra.c` and implement sorting by magnitude x $1,000,000.
   - Take a screenshot of the sorted output and name it `Extra.jpg`.
   - Upload both `Extra.c` and `Extra.jpg` to D2L.

## How to Run

1. Download the USGS earthquake data in CSV format.
2. Compile and run the `Project6.c` file to display and analyze earthquake data.
3. For extra credit, compile and run `Extra.c` to see the sorted earthquake data.

## Submission

Ensure you submit the following files by Saturday, 8/3/24:

- `Project6.c`
- Screenshot of the output (`Project6.jpg`)
- For extra credit:
  - `Extra.c`
  - Screenshot of the sorted output (`Extra.jpg`)
